# sysinfo-restapp
Simple REST application built using Flask

This application is a basic Python3 Flask application which uses the platform module to print information about the system running it.

I created it as a way to build a simple Docker container to deploy to my Raspberry Pi cluster via [k3s](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/).
